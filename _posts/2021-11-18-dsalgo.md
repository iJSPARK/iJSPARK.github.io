## Data Structure

### What is program?
Program is expression of data and process the expressed data.

---

### What is data structure?
Expression and store of data.

* Simple Structure
    1. Integer
    2. floating point
    3. Character
    4. String

---

* Linear
    1. List
    2. Stack
    3. Queue

---

* Non-Linear
    1. Tree
    2. Graph

---

* File Structure
    1. Sequential File
    2. Indexed Sequential File
    3. Direct File

## Algorithm

### What is algorithm?
Problem solving method for stored and expressed data.

When the data structure is determined, an efficient algorithm can be determined accordingly. The algorithm and depends on the data structure.

### Performance analysis method of algorithm
There are two measure here. 

* Time Complexity
* Space Complexity

In general, we focus on performance speed when algorithm measurement rathar than memory usage.
Algorithm measurement is necessary to know the increase and decrease of the performance time according to the change of the amount of data to be processed. There are two measure here. 

1. Count number of operation
2. Constitute function $T(n)$ for the number of data $n$ to be processed.


$f(x)=ax^\frac{1}{2} + bx + c$
