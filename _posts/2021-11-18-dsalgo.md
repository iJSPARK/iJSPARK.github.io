## Data Structure

### What is program?
Program is expression of data and process the expressed data.

---

### What is data structure?
Expression and store of data.

* Simple Structure
    1. Integer
    2. floating point
    3. Character
    4. String

---

* Linear
    1. List
    2. Stack
    3. Queue

---

* Non-Linear
    1. Tree
    2. Graph

---

* File Structure
    1. Sequential File
    2. Indexed Sequential File
    3. Direct File

### Study direction for data structure.
**1. Understanding for model of data structure.**
**2. Implement of data structure in code level.**

## Algorithm

### What is algorithm?
Problem solving method for stored and expressed data.

When the data structure is determined, an efficient algorithm can be determined accordingly. The algorithm and depends on the data structure.

### Performance analysis method of algorithm

1. Count number of operation
2. Constitute function $T(n)$ for the number of data n to be processed.
