* root : Node on the top of the tree
* leaf(terminal node/external node) : Last node that can no longer stretch out
* internal node(non-terminal node) : Node except leaf and root
* child : Lower node branched from the node(childeren of B node is D node)
* parent : Upper node branched from the child node(parent of D node is B node)
* sibling : Nodes have same parent(D, E node)
* height : Distance from the root to the furthest leaf
* level : Height away from the root
* degree : The number of children a node has, n-nary if all nodes are of degree n or less(The tree above is a binary tree)
* sub tree : Which node in the tree is again set as the root, 
tree of its children(Triangle is sub tree that B node as root)
* ancestor : Upper all nodes branched from the any node
* descendant : Lower all nodes branched from the any node
* null tree : Tree without node and branch
* ordered tree : Care about having order of sibling nodes
* unordered tree : Don't Care about having order of sibling nodes
