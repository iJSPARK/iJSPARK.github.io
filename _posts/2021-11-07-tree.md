## What is a tree?
Tree as a kind of graph and data structure representing hierarchical relationships between data.

### Tree related terms

* root : Node on the top of the tree
* leaf(terminal node/external node) : Last node that can no longer stretch out
* internal node(non-terminal node) : Node except leaf and root
* child : Lower node branched from the node(child of B node is D node)
* parent : Upper node branched from the child node(parent of D node is B node)
* sibling : Nodes have same parent(D, E node)
* height : Distance from the root to the furthest leaf
* level : Height away from the root
* degree : The number of child a node has, n-nary if all nodes are of degree n or less(The tree above is a binary tree)
* sub tree : Which node in the tree is again set as the root, 
tree of its child(Triangle is sub tree that B node as root)
* ancestor : Upper all nodes branched from the any node
* descendant : Lower all nodes branched from the any node
* null tree : Tree without node and branch
* ordered tree : Care about having order of sibling nodes
* unordered tree : Don't Care about having order of sibling nodes

In an ordered tree, a and b are different, but in an unordered tree, they are the same.

## BFS(Breadth-Fist Search)

## DFS(Depth-Fist Search)

## Tree Traversal
There are three main ways to explore data in depth-first search.

### Preorder Traversal
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree
3. Traverse the right subtree

**visit order**
A >> B >> D >> H >> I >> E >> J >> K >> C >> F >> L >> N >> G >> M >> O

### Inorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree

* visit order
H >> D >> I >> B >> J >> E >> K >> A >> L >> F >> N >> C >> M >> G >> O*

### Postorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the root

* visit order
H >> I >> D >> J >> K >> E >> B >> L >> N >> F >> M >> O >> G >> C >> A

## Complete Binary Tree
 Tree in which nodes are filled from the root and nodes are filled from left to right at the same level.


## Binary Tree
Binary tree has left, right child and less than two child. It is a data structure used to increase the speed of data search.
