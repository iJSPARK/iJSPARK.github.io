## What is a tree?
Tree as a kind of graph and data structure representing hierarchical relationships between data.

### Tree related terms

* root : Node on the top of the tree
* leaf(terminal node/external node) : Last node that can no longer stretch out
* internal node(non-terminal node) : Node except leaf and root
* child : Lower node branched from the node(child of B node is D node)
* parent : Upper node branched from the child node(parent of D node is B node)
* sibling : Nodes have same parent(D, E node)
* height : Distance from the root to the furthest leaf
* level : Height away from the root
* degree : The number of child a node has, n-nary if all nodes are of degree n or less(The tree above is a binary tree)
* sub tree : Which node in the tree is again set as the root, 
tree of its child(Triangle is sub tree that B node as root)
* ancestor : Upper all nodes branched from the any node
* descendant : Lower all nodes branched from the any node
* null tree : Tree without node and branch
* ordered tree : Care about having order of sibling nodes
* unordered tree : Don't Care about having order of sibling nodes

In an ordered tree, a and b are different, but in an unordered tree, they are the same.

## BFS(Breadth-Fist Search)
A search method that start at low level and search node from left to right and move on to the next level when the search is complete.

## DFS(Depth-Fist Search)
A search method that prioritizes searching down to the leaf. When the leaf is reached and there is nowhere else to proceed with the search, it returns to the parent.

## Tree Traversal
There are three main ways to explore data in depth-first search.

### Preorder Traversal
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree
3. Traverse the right subtree

* visit order  
`A >> B >> D >> H >> I >> E >> J >> K >> C >> F >> L >> N >> G >> M >> O`

### Inorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree

* visit order  
`H >> D >> I >> B >> J >> E >> K >> A >> L >> F >> N >> C >> M >> G >> O`

### Postorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the root

* visit order  
`H >> I >> D >> J >> K >> E >> B >> L >> N >> F >> M >> O >> G >> C >> A`

## Binary Tree
Binary tree has left, right child and less than two child. It is a data structure used to increase the speed of data search. Unlike a complete binary tree, a binary tree is difficult to express as an array, so pointers are needed to point to the left and right child.

## Complete Binary Tree
 Tree in which nodes are filled from the root and nodes are filled from left to right at the same level. As shown in the picture below, if 0,1,2 is given to each node, it corresponds to the index of the array in a one-to-one so it used for heap sort.

## Binary Search Tree
Binary search tree is binary tree needs to satisfy the following conditions.

* condition
1. Based on some node N, all key values ​​of the left sub tree node must be less than the key values ​​of node N.
2. The key value of the right sub tree node must be greater than the key value of node N.
3. There should be no nodes with the same key value.

<span style='background-color: #dcffe4'>Inorder traversal of a binary search tree, can get nodes in ascending order of key values.</span> 

* visit order  
`1 >> 3 >> 5 >> 6 >> 7 >> 9 >> 10 >> 11 >> 12 >> 13 >> 15 >> 16`

Binary search tree can obtain nodes in ascending order of key values ​​by inorder traversal, search is possible in a similar way to binary search, and insertion of nodes is easy. Therefore, binary search trees are widely used.
